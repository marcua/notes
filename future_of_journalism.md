# ["Whither Nanopublishing"](https://medium.com/bull-market/whither-nanopublishing-5af7bac7de1e)

A conversation between two people who think about the future of publishing online.

Having tens to hundreds of millions of readers gets you huge brands that want to do brand advertising.

The medium-to-smaller scale sucks because you can't get premium money on ads.  It gets even worse for a yahoo news-style publisher, since readers don't differentiate between news sources, and unlike facebook, you don't control the platform or how people discover you.

You might argue that people can become famous on other people's platforms (e.g., YouTube or Pinterest) but since it's not their platform, they have to do sketchy things like get affiliate links to make any money.

The really small end of the spectrum might work because you can do something closer to a newsletter for pay: low costs and super-differentiated content.
