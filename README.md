Notes on things I find interesting

I've recently found that I read articles but end up unsure what I've taken away from them.  In an effort to force myself to recap the essence of a piece, I'll try to post notes here.

Some meta-notes:
  * I imagine I'll capture less than 10% of the reading I do here.  Better than nothing!
  * The notes you see here are not my opinion so much as a recap.  As an example, I might read an article that enrages me, but I won't necessarily post what I dislike about the article: I'll try to take notes on the points the article made.  I won't be surprised if some criticisms/doubts appear in the notes as well, but that's not the point.
