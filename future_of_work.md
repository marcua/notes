# ["Previous technological innovation has always delivered more long-run employment, not less. But things can change"](http://www.economist.com/news/briefing/21594264-previous-technological-innovation-has-always-delivered-more-long-run-employment-not-less)

Automation might not cause widespread unemployment.  Instead, it might cause a gap between the inventors of new human-machine hybrid that will win big, and the folks who are pushed into lower-wage service jobs.

In the end, you might have three groups: inventors of business models, creative well-paid workers, and a large group of low-paid wage earners.

The article also made a connection to welfare that I'm not sure how I feel about: as welfare increases, the reservation wage at which a worker refuses to work for pay increases, which increases the economic benefit of automating jobs away.
