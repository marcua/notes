*Note: Since this is a public forum, I feel compelled to say that I dislike the scary implications of what's happening here.  I don't want to live in a world where people can more easily run experiments that might kill themselves or others.*

People can take existing classes of drugs that aren't yet illegal and modify them slightly so that they stay ahead of the law.

Sometimes a small change in a compound results in a terrible and different reaction, so this is dangerous.

It's gotten to the point that you can email a lab somewhere (the example was a lab in China), and they will even help you make the deliverable hard-to-detect in the mail.
